    "### A **prelude** dedicated to confusion  \n",
    "The bulk of my confusion while learning C was due to my lack of understanding regarding the scope of variables in C, and how that relates to header files, pointers and their utility. Inside of a C function, the function only has access to:\n",
    "1. the variables defined **inside** of the function\n",
    "2. and C provides access to **copies** of the variables passed into the function\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to this is that you can declare certain types of global variables that are available to all functions in that file, as discussed later, but 1 and 2 above are important. If you work with large datas sets you may realize that a function making a copy of that data just to read it could lead to running out of memory. Since we want to continue to use functions for good programming etiquite (and fewer headaches) the solution to this is pointers. If pointers didn't exist, users of C would hack this by creating long main() functions (the mandatory function in C programs) without abstraction, which is far from ideal. Pointers are a concept I was not familiar with before learning C, but they are a really neat feature of C and I would have learned to appreciate them sooner given the information above. Pointers represent the memory address of a variable rather than the contents of that location in memory (or the value of the variable). Pointers can be *dereferenced* to access the contents of that location in memory, or the stored value. This means that pointers can be passed to functions, and functions can utilize dereferencing to access or change the values of data without having to make a copy of that data in memory. These concepts are called **pass by copy (or value)** and **pass by reference (or address)**, and are discussed in more detail later. C assumes that this type of behavior should always happen for the data type **array**, so calls to arrays always yield a pointer to the array. Outside of computational science with large data sets, pointers, dereferencing, and variable scopes have implications for data access and privacy concerns in software. \n",

Simple programs can be compiled and linked with one call to gcc using `gcc -o program program.c`. This command causes gcc to first compile the .c file to an object file, then link that object file into an executable program, and finally delete the object file.  \n",

If the initialized size is larger than the number of items contained in the list, the missing elements will be zero (for automatic, static, and external variables). C doesn't keep track of array length so a sentinel values like -1 may be added to the end of the array and used to count the number of items before the sentinel, or one can define a constant that stores the length of the array using the *sizeof* operator, which returns the number of bytes occupied in memory by the argument, e.g.  \n",

To create a pointer *p* to the variable named *var*, use the syntax `p = &var;` where the `&` denotes the address of *var*. The dereferencing operator `*` accesses the contents of memory that the pointer points to, or the value stored in *var* in the example above. Pointers must be defined with a type that matches the type of the item being pointed to, so if *var* is type int, memory would be allocated for the pointer with `int *p`.  \n",

    "Functions receive copies of their input arguments, so they can not alter the values of the input variables (rather than the copies, which functions can edit) with standard assignments. Pointers and dereferencing allow functions to alter the values of their input variables. The standard practice is to pass the address of the variables to the function (using `&`) rather than the variables themselves, then use `*` to dereference the address and alter the variables.\n",

    "Arrays are consecutive items in memory and thus can be referenced with pointers. If we create an array of ten integers `int array[10]` then declare a pointer to that array of integers `int *pArray;` then assign `pArray = &array[0];`, pArray will point to the first item in *array*, thus if *z* is type int `z = *pArray` would assign the value of the first (index 0) item in array to *z*. `pArray + 1` points to the next item in memory after array[0], corresponding to array[1]. `pArray - 1` refers to the item in member before array[0]. A few interesting relationships and properties are noted  below:  \n",

A memory leak is the term prescribed to memory that is allocated and not deallocated after it is no longer needed by the program. The heap memory function prototypes found in <stdlib.h> follow, where the type *size_t* is defined in <stdlib.h> and can be thought of as an integer:  \n",

    "* realloc: changes the size of the memory block that *ptr* points to to *size* bytes and returns a pointer to the resized memory block. For larger new sizes the added memory isn't initialized. For example, `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);`\n",

    "The standard pattern for using malloc() with an instance of the type *type* is:  \n",
    "`type *p = (type *)malloc(sizeof(type));`  \n",

    "*getchar()* reads and returns one character at a time from stdin until the end of file is encountered, at which point *EOF* is returned, e.g. `int getchar(void)`.\n",

    "*putchar()* prints the specified character of specified type to stdout, as in `int putchar(int specifiedCharacter)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*printf()* prints the specified variable to the specified format on stdout and returns the number of items printed to stdout. %s specifies a string format, which should be followed by a pointer to a string. %d specifies int format and should be followed by an int, and %ld specifies long format and should be followed by a floating point number. printf() has a lot of options that aren't covered here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*scanf()* reads characters from stdin and inteprets them based on the specified format, then assigns the results and returns the number of assigned items. It is the opposite of printf(). The arguments given to scanf() for assignment must be pointers. To accept an integer from standard input and store it as the variable *distance*, we include the following lines in a program:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "int distance;\n",
    "scanf(\"%i\", &distance); \n",
    "```\n",
    "where the address of *distance* must be passed to **scanf()** so it can change the value stored in *distance*. Alternatively, assigning a string from standard input to a variable named *potato* may look like:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "char potato[];\n",
    "scanf(\"%s\", potato);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that *potato* is passed to **scanf()** without the address operator `&` since string variables point to the address of the character array. \n",

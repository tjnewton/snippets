    "### A **prelude** dedicated to confusion  \n",
    "The bulk of my confusion while learning C was due to my lack of understanding regarding the scope of variables, and how that relates to header files, pointers and their utility. Inside of a C function, the function only has access to:\n",
    "1. the variables defined **inside** of the function\n",
    "2. and C provides access to **copies** of the variables passed into the function\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to this is that you can declare certain types of global variables that are available to all functions in that file, as discussed later, but 1 and 2 above are important. If you work with large datas sets you may realize that a function making a copy of that data just to read it could lead to running out of memory. Since we want to continue to use functions for good programming etiquite (and fewer headaches) the solution to this is pointers. If pointers didn't exist, users of C would hack this by creating long main() functions (the mandatory function in C programs) without abstraction, which is far from ideal. Pointers are a concept I was not familiar with before learning C, but they are a really neat feature of C and I would have learned to appreciate them sooner given the information above. Pointers represent the memory address of a variable rather than the contents of that location in memory (or the value of the variable). Pointers can be *dereferenced* to access the contents of that location in memory, or the stored value. This means that pointers can be passed to functions, and functions can utilize dereferencing to access or change the values of data without having to make a copy of that data in memory. These concepts are called **pass by copy (or value)** and **pass by reference (or address)**, and are discussed in more detail later. C assumes that this type of behavior should always happen for the data type **array**, so calls to arrays always yield a pointer to the array. Outside of computational science with large data sets, pointers, dereferencing, and variable scopes have implications for data access and privacy concerns in software. \n",

If the initialized size is larger than the number of items contained in the list, the missing elements will be zero (for automatic, static, and external variables). C doesn't keep track of array length so a sentinel values like -1 may be added to the end of the array and used to count the number of items before the sentinel, or one can define a constant that stores the length of the array using the *sizeof* operator, which returns the number of bytes occupied in memory by the argument, e.g.  \n",

Recall that chars are stored as integers, so character types and constants can be used in arithmetic expressions. Be careful with this. \n",

    "Automatic conversion rules:\n",
    "* narrower type is converted to wider type, result is wider type\n",
    "* from highest to lowest order: long double, double, float, long long int, long int, int,\n",
    "* where char and short int types are converted to int\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid relying on automatic conversions when possible and cast the result to a specific type by including the type in parenthesis before the name of the variable, e.g. `sqrt((double)X)`. The program below shows the proper way to type cast two large ints before adding them so the result does not overflow. Try changing the line with the type cast to `sum = (unsigned long int)(int_1 + int_2);` in the program below and see how the resulting sum is incorrect. "

The dereferencing operator `*` accesses the contents of memory that the pointer points to, or the value stored in *var* in the example above.

Pointers and dereferencing allow functions to alter the values of their input variables. The standard practice is to pass the address of the variables to the function (using `&`) rather than the variables themselves, then use `*` to dereference the address and alter the variables.\n",

If we create an array of ten integers `int array[10]` then declare a pointer to that array of integers `int *pArray;` then assign `pArray = &array[0];`, pArray will point to the first item in *array*, thus if *z* is type int `z = *pArray` would assign the value of the first (index 0) item in array to *z*. `pArray + 1` points to the next item in memory after array[0], corresponding to array[1]. `pArray - 1` refers to the item in memory before array[0]. A few interesting relationships and properties are noted  below:  \n",

A memory leak is the term prescribed to memory that is allocated and not deallocated after it is no longer needed by the program.

    "* realloc: changes the size of the memory block that *ptr* points to to *size* bytes and returns a pointer to the resized memory block. For larger new sizes the added memory isn't initialized. For example, `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);`\n",

    "Many linear algebra techniques scale poorly with increasing matrix size. Conveniently, large matrices for many problems are sparse, meaning they contain many zero values. Thus a solution to the computation bottleneck is storing only non-zero values of a sparse matrix in an array, accompanied by two other arrays that store the row and column of each value entry. First the concept is illustrated with a dense matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix that is full of non-zero values is called a dense matrix. For example:  \n",
    "$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "1.0 & 8.1 & 5.6 \\\\\n",
    "6.4 & 9.3 & 9.9 \\\\\n",
    "3.2 & 0.7 & 3.7 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$  \n",

    "**values =** $\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "1.0 & 8.1 & 5.6 & 6.4 & 9.3 & 9.9 & 3.2 & 0.7 & 3.7 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$   \n",

    "0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$   \n",
    "And the last array representing the column of each entry in the **values** array:   \n",
    "**column =** $\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$  \n",

The row indices array only contains one value for each row with non-zero data, and that value specifies the index of the column array that starts that row. At the end of the row indices array a termination index is appended and it's value is the number of rows in the matrix containing non-zero values. The same sparse matrix defined above would be represented in CSR as a **values** array and **column** array as above:  \n",

    "0 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$  \n",

One naive implementation simply uses an adjacency list, which is an array of linked lists that contain the neighbors of each vertex in the graph, and three separate arrays to implement graph traveral. These arrays represent:  \n",
    "* visited_status (or color): 0 [not visited], 1 [in the queue], or 2 [visited]\n",
    "* distance: integer representing distance to vertex\n",
    "* parent: ID of the parent vertex (generally an integer to represent ID) \n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are slow at scale, but we're in luck since the SpMV kernel can be used for BFS if the adjacency list is represented as a sparse matrix. The transpose of the sparse matrix (containing the adjacency list for each vertex ID) represents the neighbors of each vertex, where each row contains 1's if the column index is a vertex neighboring the row index vertex, and 0's for non-neighbors. The input vector used in SpMV of size #_of_columns x 1, containing all 0's except for a 1 at the row index corresponding to the vertex you want to find neighbors of. The resulting vector is of size #_of_columns x 1 and contains 1's at the row index corresponding to vertices that are neighbors to the specified vertex in the input vector, and 0's for non-neighbors. The input vector used in SpMV for BFS can also contain more than one 1 (multiple vertices) in which case the output vector will be the union of the adjacency lists of the specified vertices.  "

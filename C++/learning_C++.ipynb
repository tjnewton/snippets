The skills to thoroughly understand C programs are built gradually throughout this notebook. The main thing to keep in mind is that users must manage their own memory in C, as there is no garbage collection, which is the source of most bugs in C. Start the C journey with the knowledge that single line comments start with `//` and multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. "

    "### A **prelude** dedicated to confusion  \n",
    "The bulk of my confusion while learning C was due to my lack of understanding regarding the scope of variables, and how that relates to header files, pointers and their utility. Inside of a C function, the function only has access to:\n",
    "1. the variables defined **inside** of the function\n",
    "2. and C provides access to **copies** of the variables passed into the function\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to this is that you can declare certain types of global variables that are available to all functions in that file, as discussed later, but 1 and 2 above are important. If you work with large datas sets you may realize that a function making a copy of that data just to read it could lead to running out of memory. Since we want to continue to use functions for good programming etiquite (and fewer headaches) the solution to this is pointers. If pointers didn't exist, users of C would hack this by creating long main() functions (the mandatory function in C programs) without abstraction, which is far from ideal. Pointers are a concept I was not familiar with before learning C, but they are a really neat feature of C and I would have learned to appreciate them sooner given the information above. Pointers represent the memory address of a variable rather than the contents of that location in memory (or the value of the variable). Pointers can be *dereferenced* to access the contents of that location in memory, or the stored value. This means that pointers can be passed to functions, and functions can utilize dereferencing to access or change the values of data without having to make a copy of that data in memory. These concepts are called **pass by copy (or value)** and **pass by reference (or address)**, and are discussed in more detail later. C assumes that this type of behavior should always happen for the data type **array**, so calls to arrays always yield a pointer to the array. Outside of computational science with large data sets, pointers, dereferencing, and variable scopes have implications for data access and privacy concerns in software. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook wanders through the fundamentals and various aspects of C, building on example programs of increasing complexity and the information necessary to understand them. I recommend tinkering with the code, figuring out how to break it, then figuring out how to fix it. "

    "2. compile source files into object files (binary representations)\n",

    "C source files are compiled into object files which contain:\n",
    "1. global names defined in the source file (either global variables or functions)\n",
    "2. function and variable names that weren't resolved in the source file\n",
    "3. machine instructions to implement the statements in the source file  \n",
    "\n",
    "The linker follows the following steps:  \n",
    "1. first attempts to match unresolved global names between all specified object files\n",
    "2. then attempts to find remaining unresolved global names in libraries\n",
    "3. if unresolved global names still exist error messages are primted. if all global names are resolved an executable image is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "gcc is the name of the C compiler and linker on Linux. To compile a source file titled program.c into a binary object file titled program.o use `gcc -c program.c`. The -c flag makes gcc only compile (not link). To link the object file into an executable program titled program use `gcc -o program program.o`, then execute the file using `./program`. Simple programs can be compiled and linked with one call to gcc using `gcc -o program program.c`. This command causes gcc to first compile the .c file to an object file, then link that object file into an executable program, and finally delete the object file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "gcc will report errors to standard error output. When learning C use the -W and -Wall flags with gcc to report poor programming practices, e.g. `gcc -c -W -Wall program.c`."

    "\n",
    "It's now appropriate to discuss the beauty of a C kernel, or the magic behind how you were able to execute the hello world script above without knowing about gcc. C programs need to be compiled and linked to produce an executable file that can then be run. A C kernel allows rapid iteration of programs, which I find to be particularly useful when learning a language. Just run the cell and the C kernel takes care of the rest. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you compile the above hello world program using `gcc -W -Wall -o hello hello.c` you will see errors about the unused arguments argc and argv and the executable will still be produced. **main()** takes two parameters, **argc** and **argv**, which we didn't use in the above program so the -W and -Wall flags generate these warnings. To be a courteous and less error-prone developer use the **UNUSED** attribute to indicate that parameters or variables are unused on purpose. To do this, replace the line `int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {` with the two lines:  \n",

I learned using VirtualBox (free) and ArchLinux (free) while taking notes in a notebook with a C kernel. Highly reccommend 10/10 would box & kernel again, but do not rely only on the C kernel. "
